# **JFK files (2025) converted to searchable pdfs**
# **A JFK edition (free) of a research application**


The JFK files, released on 18 March 2025, are a treasure trove of information for researchers, journalists, book writers, historians, and anyone interested in the JFK case. However, the sheer volume of the files and their format - scans of original documents - make them difficult to navigate and search through. 

This repository aims to solve that problem by providing the JFK files converted into searchable PDFs. This means you can now easily search for specific information within the files, saving you countless hours of manual searching. 

But the repository goes a step further. It also includes a free JFK edition of a research application originally designed for academic research. This application is a powerful tool that allows you to search all the documents at once or in batches, save your search results, and even search within your saved results. 

The application also includes features specifically designed for qualitative research. You can code the text of the released documents, group these codes, and create concepts and theories based on them. The application's workbench allows you to perform concept analyses, helping you to draw meaningful conclusions from the data. 

To use the data in the app, you need to download both the JFK files and the research application. Once downloaded, unzip the app anywhere on your computer or a USB stick. However, ensure that the "JFKfiles2025" folder is located inside the folder where the app is, otherwise the app won't be able to find the files. 

A short video tutorial is also provided to help you get started with the app. 

This repository and the tools it provides are a significant step forward in the research of the JFK case. With this technology, it's possible that new insights and theories could be uncovered, bringing us closer to understanding one of the most enduring mysteries of our time. Good luck with your research!
